# Udacity_Self_Driving_Car_Project_4_Behavioral_Cloning
In this project, a Behavioral Cloning model has been implemented. This model tries to learn with manual driving data and mimic the behavior and drives around the same tracka autonomously. More details regarding the project are provided in the write up file.
The model.py has the main training network. Drive.py drives the car autonomously with the help of the build neural network model.
Video.py helps in recording video of driving.
making_video.py makes a video from the collected image when driving autonomously because sometimes video.py does not work.
